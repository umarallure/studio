## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to evoke a sense of energy, competition, and trustworthiness. This is inspired by the professional, competitive spirit of a tournament, yet it should also be accessible.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#E0F7FA), offering a clean, modern backdrop that ensures readability and focus on the data-rich content.
- Accent color: A dynamic green (#90EE90), is selected to highlight achievements, winning scores, and positive performance metrics. This green complements the primary blue while creating visual contrast.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a contemporary, precise feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability and a modern look. Used to make text clear and easy to read in large blocks, such as descriptions and details in the app.
- Use sharp, vector-based icons related to scoring metrics, dashboards, and user actions.  The style should match a simple, geometric look to harmonize with the fonts chosen.
- Maintain a clean, well-organized layout, making it easy to navigate the bracket and access center-specific dashboards.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and enhance the user experience. For example, when scores update or a team advances, there could be a smooth, animated visual cue.
